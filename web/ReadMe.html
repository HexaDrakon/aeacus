<h2>Competition Guidelines</h2><ul><li> In order to provide a better competition experience, you are <b>NOT</b> required to change the password of the primary, auto-login, user account. Changing the password of a user that is set to automatically log in may lock you out of your computer.</li><li> Authorized administrator passwords were correct the last time you did a password audit, but are not guaranteed to be currently accurate.</li><li> Do not stop or disable the CCS Client service or process.</li><li> Do not remove any authorized users or their home directories.</li><li> The time zone of this image is set to UTC. Please do not change the time zone, date, or time on this image.</li><li> You can view your current scoring report by double-clicking the "CyberPatriot Scoring Report" desktop icon.</li><li> JavaScript is required for some error messages that appear on the "CyberPatriot Scoring Report." To ensure that you only receive correct error messages, please do not disable JavaScript.</li><li> Some security settings may prevent the Stop Scoring application from running. If this happens, the safest way to stop scoring is to suspend the virtual machine. You should <b>NOT</b> power on the VM again before deleting.</li></ul><p align="center" style="text-align:center"> The Aeacus Project is in no way affiliated or endorsed by the Air Force Association or the University of Texas at San Antonio.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="footer-copyright-wrap"><div class="container"><div class="footer-copyright-content"><ul><li>Copyright Never &copy;</li><li>No rights reserved</li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
